# Cross-compilation notes (martin@lucina.net)
# This particular build system is a total mess.
# The following sequence of steps seems to work for cross-compiling:
# 1. Build myocamlbuild plugin with host compiler.
# 2. Run OASIS -configure with cross compiler.
# 3. Build nocrypto_bindgen.byte with host compiler and run it.
#    XXX: No feedback from nocrypto_bindgen on whether or not it succeeded.
# 4. Run OASIS -build with cross compiler.
# TODO: Verify that the above sequence does the right thing. The logical steps
# (to me) are to let step 4 run nocrypto_bindgen, however for some unknown
# reason it insists on *always* rebuilding nocrypto_bindgen with the cross
# compiler.
