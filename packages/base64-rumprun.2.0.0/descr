Base64 encoding and decoding library

Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent
binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64
representation.  It is specified in RFC 2045.

From version 2.0 upwards, the module name is called `B64` to avoid clashing
with other libraries such as `extlib` that use the `Base64` toplevel name.
