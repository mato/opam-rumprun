Convert file extensions to MIME types

This library contains a database of MIME types that maps filename extensions
into MIME types suitable for use in many Internet protocols such as HTTP or
e-mail.  It is generated from the `mime.types` file found in Unix systems, but
has no dependency on a filesystem since it includes the contents of the
database as an ML datastructure.

For example, here's how to lookup MIME types in the [utop] REPL:

    #require "magic-mime";;
    Magic_mime.lookup "/foo/bar.txt";;
    - : bytes = "text/plain"
    Magic_mime.lookup "bar.css";;
    - : bytes = "text/css"
